Broker's Gin is made in a 200-year-old distillery in the heart of England using a traditional copper pot still, with the recipe as old as the distillery. A quadruple-distilled pure grain spirit made from English wheat is redistilled with ten traditional botanicals, creating a Gin of outstanding flavour and smoothness. Broker's Gin does not follow the modern trend of using weird and wonderful spirits and botanicals - they believe our forefathers did an unbeatable job perfecting Gin recipes over many hundreds of years.
Broker's Gin has won more top awards in international competition over the last ten years than any other Gin including an impressive 97/100 at the 2010 Ultimate Spirits Challenge - the highest ever mark awarded to a Gin.",a,"Distilled from 100% grain spirit

Corona has been brewed and bottled in Mexico since 1925.  It is lighter than traditional beers, with a crisp and refreshing taste. The aroma is fruity-honey with a touch of malt and the flavour is crisp and well-balanced between hops and malt, toward the malt side. 

Whatever the time of year, Corona is best served ice cold ad with a wedge of lime, that both complements and intensifies the flavour.

Corona's superior taste profile is due to the fact that our brewers take great care to use only the best ingredients available, made with the finest quality blend of filtered water, malted barley, hops, corn and yeast.

To guarantee the best quality upon arrival, GUINNESS brewers made a porter with more hops and higher gravity. 

The recipe was a success and was soon shipped far and wide to countries in the Caribbean, America, Africa and South East Asia. Its ancestor, GUINNESS FOREIGN EXTRA STOUT is still sold there today.

With origins in an 1801 entry in GUINNESS' brewers' diaries, today's GUINNESS WEST INDIES PORTER was inspired by the first beer purposely brewed at St. James's Gate to sustain its freshness, wherever it was shipped.

Kumala keeps on going from strength to strength and is arguably producing the best wine it has ever made under the confident leadership of Bruce Jack. The reason for this is the close relationship between the grape growers and our top winemakers. South Africa's wine producing area has 5 distinct regions, divided into 14 distinct districts. At Kumala, grapes are sourced from a number of these regions so that only the best quality is chosen. The grapes for Kumala Cape Red were fermented in stainless steel tanks to keep the juicy red fruit aromas before contact with French oak to add some spice and tannin.
